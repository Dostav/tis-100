## Important Note for Contributors

This guide is largely unmaintained as of September 2018, and I may not even have TIS-100 installed at any given time. I'll log into GitHub to review pull requests every few months. Please remember to:
1. Add your solution under `save/`.
2. Update the explanation in `chapter[00-99].md`.
3. Add yourself to the list of authors in `index.md`.
4. Comment on your PR and attach a screenshot from the game showing your improved speed/size/node count.
